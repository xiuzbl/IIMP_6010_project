TSP problems and visulization (easy)

We add weather condition and traffic condition in the map provided by our professor. Under these conditions, edge weights will be changed according to different degree of conditions. We compare the shorest tours of TSP (Traveling Salemans Problems) under these conditions which are gained through genetic optimation algorithm. 

Functions I use are stored in iimp6010.py. 

You can simply check the notebook.
